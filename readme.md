# What is Lora Node

Makerfabs Lora Node is a series of products based on Arduino Pro Mini (328P) + Lora(SX127X). 

Like Relay, AC Dimmer, Mosfet, etc.

For easy to use, UID and generic instructions are provided.

Some of them are our previous products, but have not added UID yet. Please refer to status of Lora Node List below.

## Feature

- ATMEL Atmega328P
- Semtech SX127X

- Unique ID, can be used directly without secondary programming.

## Lora Node List

| NUM  | Type                                                         | Short    | Status      |

|      |                                                              |          |             |

## Transmission Device

You can use a Lora Node as the sending device.

You can also use our other products, or other Lora devices.

# Generic Lora Command

## UID

UID is the factory serial number of manual burning, manual modification when burning, has nothing to do with the equipment.The action continues only when a command with the same device ID is received.

The first two digits indicate the device type number, and the last four digits indicate the serial number.

```c
03					0001
Type:Relay			Serial number:0001
```



## Command

The Lora command is a generic isometric instruction that is transmitted as a string as follows:

```c
ID000123ACT114PARAM012345
```

Divided into three parts:

- Device ID: ID000123
- Action ID: ACT001
- Parameter: PARAM000000

The preceding zeros must not be omitted.

### Device ID(UID)

Generally, the value is ID+6 digits.

```
ID000123
```

Can be customized by the user, also provided to get the 328P chip UID routines.

### Action ID

All LoraNode must implement the following two basic commands. (Including read-only terminals)

| ACT  | PARAM             | Description                                                  |
| ---- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 114  | 000000(not parse) | Querying node status                                         |
| 000  | 000000(not parse) | All functions are disabled. The read-only terminal does not perform any action, but it is necessary to reply. |
|      |                   |                                                              |

 

## General Reply

Lora node does not actively upload data to ensure that the channel is smooth. Instead, LoraGetway actively sends commands to control the channel.

To facilitate parsing, use string reply.



The reply format is as follows:

```c
ID012345[space]REPLY[space]:[space][replay data]
```

Spaces cannot be omitted.



# How To Use

## Complier Option

**If you have any questionsï¼Œsuch as how to install the development board, how to download the code, how to install the library. Please refer to :[Makerfabs_FAQ](https://github.com/Makerfabs/Makerfabs_FAQ)**

- Please disconnect from the electrical equipment before burning!
- Do not burn with alternating current!
- Install library: RadioLib and other libs.
- Upload codes, select "Arduino Pro or Pro Mini" and "3.3V 8MHz"



## Uploader

There is no USB socket or integrated serial port chip on some modules. But there are serial ports: VCC, GND, RX, TX, DTR. 

There are two ways to connect a serial port.



### MakerFabs CP2104 USB2UART

Product link : [CP2104 USB2UART](https://www.makerfabs.com/cp2104-usb-to-serial-converter.html)

![cp2104](md_pic/cp2104.png)

This CP2104 USB to Serial Converter is super tiny, a highly-integrated USB-to-UART Bridge Controller providing a simple solution for updating and programming.

The serial port module has the same pin position as the makerfabs module with no USB port.So just plug it into the hole.

![cp2104](md_pic/cp2104-2.png)

The usage of usb cable is the same after that.

### CP2102 MODULES USB TO TTL

There are many common usb serial port modules on the market, which are basically connected in a common way.

| Makerfabs | USB To TTL |
| --------- | ---------- |
| VCC       | 3.3V       |
| GND       | GND        |
| RX        | TXD        |
| TX        | RXD        |
